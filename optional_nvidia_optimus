1. Disconnect any external/secondary monitors.
2. Install video and optimus drivers: 

    sudo apt install nvidia-361 nvidia-prime

3. Reboot your machine and login.
4. Open the "Nvidia X Server Settings" app, go to the "PRIME Profiles" section and choose "NVIDIA".
5. Close the settings app.
6. Logout and login again, so the profile change can take effect.

A small annoyance: 
while the "NVIDIA" profile is active you cannot (at the moment) use a secondary screen. It will crash your X server.

Important: 
remember to go back to the "Intel" profile whenever you don't want to use your gpu anymore, logout and login back for it to take effect. Otherwise, your gpu will be using lots of power for nothing.

Finish the installation by doing this things manually:

 * Configure ssh access:
   edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config with
      PermitRootLogin no
      AllowUsers fisa invitado
   then restart the ssh service
 * Configure settings for:
   * Gnome (wallpaper, themes, fonts, window buttons, behaviour, favorite apps, some of them from gnome tweak tool)
   * Gnome-shell extensions listed in gnome-shell-extensions.html
   * Chrome/firefox (user/sync)
   * User (avatar)
   * Gnome settings app:
       * Sources for gnome shell autocomplete, under Search
       * Disable recent files under Privacy/Usage & History
 * Ulauncher (plugins from 7_ulauncher_extensions.txt, theme, etc, remember to set shortcut to something I don't really use)
 * Add shortcut (settings > keyboard > shortcuts > custom) pointing to ulauncher-toggle when ctrl+space
 * Install steam from the website, run it, install games
 * Configure the compose key (gnome-tweak-tool, under keyboard and shortcuts)
 * Review and adjust swap file size: /home/fisa/kb/linux_swap.rst
 * Decide if disabling tracker is a good idea (it usually is, cpu hog and high disk usage): /home/fisa/kb/disable_tracker.rst
